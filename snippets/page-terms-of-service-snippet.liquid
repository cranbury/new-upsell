	<strong>22.	International Access:</strong> Our Website is provided from the United States of America. The laws of other countries may differ regarding the access and use of the Website.  We make no representations regarding the legality of this Website in any other country and it is your responsibility to ensure that your use complies with all applicable laws outside of the U.S.A.  
<p class="ancillary-p">    
	<strong>23.	Governing Law; Dispute Resolution; Class Action Waiver.</strong> The laws of the State of Michigan shall govern these Terms and Conditions. While we will make reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements you may have with Company, if these efforts fail you agree that all claims, disputes or controversies between you and the Company arising out of these Terms and Conditions, or the purchase of any products or services (“Claims”) shall be exclusively submitted to binding arbitration, no matter what legal theory they are based on or what remedy (damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief) they seek. This includes Claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or our negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other sources of law; Claims made as counterclaims, cross-claims, third- party claims, interpleaders or otherwise; and Claims made independently or with other claims. In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these official rules and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief, and the parties have the right to be represented by counsel of their choice. <strong>In arbitration, however, (i) there is no judge or jury (ii) the proceedings and outcome are generally subject to certain confidentiality rules, (iii) the discovery process is limited, and (iv) a court’s review of the arbitrator’s ruling is extremely limited.</strong>
<p class="ancillary-p">    
	The party filing arbitration must submit Claims to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and follow its rules and procedures for initiating and pursuing arbitration. Any in-person hearing in the arbitration will be held in the same city as the U.S. District Court closest to your then-current residential address, or at some other place to which you and Company agree in writing. The arbitrator shall apply Michigan law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act. You may obtain copies of the current AAA Rules, and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration, by contacting the AAA at 800-778-7879, or by visiting the AAA’s website at <a href="http://www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>.  
<p class="ancillary-p">    
	A single, neutral arbitrator will resolve Claims. The arbitrator will be either a lawyer with at least ten (10) years’ experience or a retired or former judge, selected in accordance with the AAA rules. The arbitration will follow the AAA’s then-current Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”), unless those AAA Rules are inconsistent with these Terms and Conditions, in which case these Terms and Conditions govern.  The payment of all AAA and arbitrator fees and costs will be in accordance with the AAA Rules.  Subject to those AAA Rules, each party to the arbitration will bear the expense of its own attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but the prevailing party in the arbitration may recover any or all costs or expenses from the other party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law and the AAA Rules, so determines. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on the parties.
<p class="ancillary-p">    
	The foregoing notwithstanding, both parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for any dispute or claim falling within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction.
<p class="ancillary-p">    
	<strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, “PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL” ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND. CLAIMS AND REMEDIES SOUGHT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION ARE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS.  
<p class="ancillary-p">    
	If, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to these Terms and Conditions holds that this class action waiver provision is unenforceable as to any Claim you have brought, then our agreement to arbitrate will not apply, and your Claim must be brought exclusively in court in the City of Birmingham, Oakland County, Michigan.
<p class="ancillary-p">    
	<strong>Time Bar:</strong> ANY CLAIM YOU HAVE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF THE CLAIM.
